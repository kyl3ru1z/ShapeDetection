# ShapeDetection
Uses OpenCV to detect multiple shapes. to detect shapes with this method all of your shapes have to be the same color (mine were all red and had upper hsv values of [0, 100, 151] and lower hsv values of [179, 193, 206]). After detecting that certain color, I draw contours around that shape and counted the approximated number of shapes. 

# What I Learned 
- Color detection
- Implementing Contours 
- Utilizing OpenCV to draw text and rectangles
